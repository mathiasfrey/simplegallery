Add some nice HTML/CSS/JS interface

Interface could look like

  INDEX -> PHOTO SITE

  or

  INDEX   // especially for smaller libraries
    PHOTO
    PHOTO
    PHOTO
    ...

Add a logo (for the sake of our marketing department)
Add functionality:
  - actually use exif data
  - use db file for titles, descriptions, geo locations etc.
  - integrate with other services (Google maps)

Put index.html into _web (can be reproduced).

DONE: Add a templating engine, e.g. Jinja2
