simplegallery
-------------
Produces a gallery of images from a given directory.

Warning
-------
This software is not intended to be used by non Python experts.
You should be able to install some dependencies by yourself(, just
check the error messages).

Motivation
----------
After ten years of digital photography and presenting my images
online I have finally decided what fits my needs best: a simple
gallery script that produces plain old HTML and CSS; no databases,
web frameworks etc. involved. 

Main focus is to present your photos and have them backuped easily. Just
place all your photos in a single directory and run the script. 

Everything not so important (thumbnails, websites) is stored in a folder 
called '_web'. Just exclude this folder from your backup - you
can reproduce everything from your base directory, promise!
